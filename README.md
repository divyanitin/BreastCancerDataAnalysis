### Classifying samples as tumor or normal based on measurements from images

Typically, biopsy tissue samples from breast cancer are preserved on paraffin slide and examined
visually by a pathologist. Cancerous tissues have more misshapen cells, larger nuclei, rough
surfaces and other abnormal characteristics. Today, automated image analysis can collect
measurements of the nuclei of the cells in a picture of a sample without human intervention. From
the UC-Irvine machine learning archive we have the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, with nuclei
measurements of 569 samples, some benign and some tumor.
